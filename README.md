## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
This is a basic MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) single-page web application project written in TypeScript. It is a simple user login/account management app with JWT authentication. You can register a new user account with your email address, name and password. After successful registration, you can log in and view your user data. This app was created for learning purpose, but is might be useful as a starting-point for other projects.
The API uses:
- MongoDB (Mongoose) noSQL database
- node.js (Express) RESTful API
- Angular 9 (Typescript) SPA
- Bootstrap 4 style
- JWT for authentication

If any question, please do not hesitate to contact me.

- write "docker-compose up --build" and press Enter
### 5.2. Build and run with SDK <a name="build-and-run-with-sdk"></a>

- download and install node.js, MongoDB
- clone or download the content of the repository

**MongoDB**
- check if MongoDB server is running as a service

**Backend**
- open a terminal and navigate to the folder "express-server"
- write "npm install" and press Enter
- after package installation is finished, write "npm start" in the terminal and press Enter

- add possibility to modify and delete account
- Facebook authentication
- adding roles (admin, user)
